# MachineLearning-OPTimized-Algorithms
Here I will keep the Algorithms that I wrote, or cool examples with packages that I found on web.

## Descriptions

* [mlopt/omodels](mlopt/omodels) contains the general usage optimized models
* [mlopt/optimizers](mlopt/optimizers) contains the optimizers
* [mlopt/timeseries](mlopt/timeseries) contains timeseries specific optimized models
